### Juvenile Libertarians

Ouch, I am afriad that I think [Brian Leiter](http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2014/01/why-women-arent-welcome-on-the-internet.html) got it right about the EFF. 

> It also reveals that, once again, the Elecronic Frontier Foundation is on the morally depraved side of the issue.  (At what point will so-called progressive law professors become ashamed to ally themselves with the juvenile libertarians of EFF, the leading supporters of keeping cyberspace the cesspool it is?)


I guess I was kind of hiding the fact that I think that from myself because it's hard to think of the EFF as anything else but do-gooders. Or, at least I am very used to thinking that they are the guys and gals on "our side".

In fact, I guess I can admit to myself now that juvenile libertarianism is where most public advocacy groups and companies go when they promote a privacy agenda or discuss a privacy policy. 

This is why I've resisted temptation of researching Privacy Policy: Too many people are doing people, and not for the right reasons. At least not my idea of right, which is not, as Leiter is suggesting, 

Just to clarify, I don't think I agree with the paper that got Leiter to share his opinion about the EFF, or that I believe its description of women's experience online (certainly, it's not my online experience, but this obviously is nisht ahin, nisht aher,=.)
