### Good things *might* be in tow for CC

CC is finally looking for a new CEO. I can't help but being happy about that. Maybe you've given up, but I still think that the shell of CC could be revived and take off to become the *global* bellwether of IP policy.

### How?

There are genuinely talented people at CC right now, professional, spirited, leaders, but they need someone to lead the way. You would think that it would be difficult to find the right person, but it isn't. It's so blatantliy obvious who that is that I can't fathom why this hasn't happened long ago.

### Who?

Mike Linksvayer. Taking the pain to copy & paste to make it more obvious:
Mike Linksvayer.

He is professional. He is well respected. He is smart and everybody knows that. He is known. He has been there from the start and have fulfilled almost every role within the org. He is a doer. He has a vision. 

### Does anybody really need me to say that?
