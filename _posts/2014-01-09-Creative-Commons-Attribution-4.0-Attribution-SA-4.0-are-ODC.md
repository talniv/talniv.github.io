### Standards are Important

the [Open Definition Advisory Council](http://opendefinition.org/advisory-council/)
approved the CC 4.0 Attribution ([BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) and Attribution-ShareAlike ([BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)) International licenses as conformant with the Open Definition. 

These are the [open definitions](http://opendefinition.org/od/) that the ODAC test for, and this is the list of [conforming licenses](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/). Note that neither of the Non-Commercial or No-Derivatives *FLAVORS* of the CC licenses are deemed conforming.

TVOL wrote the post and note that Mike Linksvayer is behind the ODAC (just mentioning as further evidence, that I really consider superfluous, that supports my opinion in my post about CC CEOship).
