Yes, I think that like the [Huffington Case](http://gigaom.com/2011/04/13/arianna-huffington-slave-owner-or-crowdsourcing-pioneer/) this class action [Waze founder in 2006: Maps belong to the community](http://www.haaretz.com/business/1.582920) against Waze founders will come to nothing, but it's really time to consider who should have control of different modes of exploitation of content contributed by users to a platfom.
