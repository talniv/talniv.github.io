##### Interesting news from Getty Images and Copyright
This is from the IPKAT, 3.6,2014

My contribution here is in picking and choosing the interesting paragraphs and in them just highlighting stuff that are important: 

"
Craig Peters told the British Journal of Photography, Getty Image wishes to foster three different values widely undermined by wild-sharing: 

    “First, there will be attribution around that image … Second, all of the images will link back to our site and directly to the image’s details page. So anybody that has a valid commercial need for that image will be able to license that imagery from our website. Third, since all the images are served by Getty Images, we’ll have access to the information on who and how that image is being used and viewed, and we’ll reserve the right to utilise that data to the benefit of our business.”

**The brand new free-to-use model, however, is not for all. In the mind of Getty Images, contents will be freely available for non-commercial usages only** ["embedded images may not be used for commercial purposes", the embedding panel warns], while anyone who intends to use contents within professional activities must still ask for a classic copyright licence. **Remarkably, Getty Images adopts a notion of “commercial usage” that is far more user-friendly than that adopted by some Courts in Europe. Indeed, according to what Mr Peters declared to the British Journal of Photography, Getty Images considers websites using Google-Ads a non-commercial:** “the fact today that a website is generating revenue would not limit the use of the embed. What would limit that use is if they used our imagery to promote a service, a product or their business. They would need to get a license.”




####Again this is me: 
"remarakable" indeed, and I was worried that Google might have to pay... Thank goodness for the kind warm hearted people of Getty Images.
